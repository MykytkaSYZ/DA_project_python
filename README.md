# DATA ANALYSIS PYTHON REP

:blush: In this repository I have collected several personal data analytics projects.

# PROJECT 1: :bar_chart: Amazon Sales | [code](https://github.com/MykytkaSYZ/DA_project_python/blob/main/Data_Analys(Amazon%20Sales).ipynb)
In this mini-project, I explored a dataset of Amazon products to practice my data preprocessing and visualization skills.
I cleaned the data by fixing category labels, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting messy text columns into clean numerical formats.
After preparing the dataset, I built several visualizations to dig into the data:
- "the distribution of products across categories",
- "the top 10 highest-rated products",
- "a heatmap showing correlations between discounts, prices, and ratings",
- "and even a look at which categories have the best average ratings".

I wrapped it up by highlighting the products offering the biggest discounts.
This project helped me sharpen my skills with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and it was a lot of fun uncovering the hidden stories inside the data!

# PROJECT 2: ðŸ“š Web Scraping and Analysis of Wikipedia | [code](https://github.com/MykytkaSYZ/DA_project_python/blob/main/Exploring%20Wikipedia_%20Web%20Scraping%2C%20Data%20Cleaning%2C%20and%20Visualization.ipynb)
In this mini-project, we explore web scraping techniques by collecting data from Wikipedia articles using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
After extracting titles, text, and internal links, we clean and organize the data with `pandas`, and finally visualize it using `matplotlib`.

The main goals of this project are:
- Practice real-world HTML parsing
- Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing
- Generate simple and insightful visualizations
